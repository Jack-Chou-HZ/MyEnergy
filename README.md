# About how to make a release
1. Run these commands in the root directory to make a release:
    1. `yarn lint` // Use eslint to perform a static check of *.js files
    2. `yarn transf` // Transform the *.jsx files into *.js files using babel cli
    3. `yarn downgrade` // Downgrade the ES2015+ *.js files into ECMAScript 5th edition formate using babel cli
    4. `yarn compress` // Compress the ECMAScript 5th edition files (as is or into a single bundle.js file)
2. About the `./release` directory:
    1. The `./release` directory is generated by running the:`yarn compress` command.<br/>
    2. And `./release` directory is served by nginx via the http protocol
3. The behavior of the `yarn compress` command is configured by the r.compress.config.js
4. The `r.compress.config.js` config file has two options:
    1. compress the js files one by one and out put them one by one
    2. compress the js files and bundle them into one file
    <br/>Neither of the option take care of non-js files (such as ./assets, and html files), so we need to copy them into the `./release` directory manually (that's what the makeuprelease.sh
  script does)
5. When using the `4.2` option to make a release, we still need the require.js to be loaded before the bundle.js file,
 so the script tag in the index.html file is modified slightly
 into:<br/> `<script async data-main='./bundle.js' src='./require.js'>`
 And the require.js file could be a compressed version or an original version
